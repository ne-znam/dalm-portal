 * =================================================================================================================
 * Grid naming conventions for homepages
 * =================================================================================================================
 * 
 * The class names of the grid areas, that won't be changed on the homepage variations:
 *
 *      .row-<row number>__<module class name shown on desktop view>[--<number of element>]
 *
 * The "row number" is independent from modified parts of the homepage variations
 *
 * The "module class name shown on desktop view" is the classname of the child element but not atoms,
 * e.g. cannot be "aras-label", "aras-tag" or "aras-btn"
 *
 * The "number of element" is used, when there are more same module in a row.
 *
 * Examples: 
 *
 *      .row-3__news-4
 *      .row-4__kaufland-banners
 *
 * When 3x News 3 are in a row:
 *
 *      .row-5__news-3--1
 *      .row-5__news-3--2
 *      .row-5__news-3--3
 *
 *
 * Naming of homepage-spacific parts:
 *
 *      .mod-hp-<homepage number>-<row number>-<column number>__<module class name shown on desktop view>[--<number of element>]
 *
 * "hp" = homepage
 * "homepage number" is the number of homepage variation (1 - 5)
 * "row number" is the modified row number, it must be independent from common grid numbering (from .row-<number>)
 * "column number" is the column number in the modified row
 * "module class name shown on desktop view" is the classname of the child element but not atoms,
 * e.g. cannot be "aras-label", "aras-tag" or "aras-btn"
 * "number of element" is used, when there are more same module in a row
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *      The first modified row on homepage-1 contains a "News with image and list" module,
 *      second row contains 3x "Portrait banner" modules and the third row contains again
 *      a "News with image and list" module and a "News 3" module:
 *
 *      .mod-hp-1-1__news-with-image-and-list   // row 1
 *      .mod-hp-1-2__portrait-banner--1         // row 2
 *      .mod-hp-1-2__portrait-banner--2         // row 2
 *      .mod-hp-1-2__portrait-banner--3         // row 2
 *      .mod-hp-1-3__news-with-image-and-list   // row 3
 *      .mod-hp-1-3__news-3                     // row 3
